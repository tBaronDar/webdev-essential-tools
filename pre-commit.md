# Pre-commit

Pre-commit is a script that runs **ESLint** and **Prettier** checks on our code when we run:

```bash
git commit
```

It requires python and pip installed on the computer.

## What you NEED to do:

Install it by running(when you are in the project directory and the project has a local git):

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

Check if it was installed by running:

```bash
pre-commit --version
```
